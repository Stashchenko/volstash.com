# Immich × Home Assistant ![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/stashchenko/immich-home-assistant) ![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/stashchenko/immich-home-assistant/validate.yml)

This custom integration for Home Assistant allows you to display random pictures from your Immich instance right inside your dashboards.

### What is Immich?

Immich is a "high performance self-hosted photo and video backup solution".  
[Find more on their website](https://immich.app).

### What is Home Assistant?

Home Assistant provides "open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first".  
[Find more on their website](https://www.home-assistant.io).

## Installation

Install this component _via_ [HACS](https://hacs.xyz).

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?repository=immich-home-assistant&category=Integration&owner=stashchenko)

Restart Home Assistant once the integration has been installed.

## What can I do with this project?

As a suggestion, you could use this integration to create a picture frame. You can create a "pane" dashboard, and display your picture entity inside of it:

```yaml
type: panel
title: Photo frame
path: photo-frame
icon: mdi:image-frame
subview: true
cards:
  - type: picture-entity
    entity: image.immich_favorite_image
    show_state: false
    show_name: false
    aspect_ratio: "16:9"
    fit_mode: contain
```

You can then use this dashboard on a dedicated device in kiosk mode.

You could even display in onto a Nest Hub device with the [Home Assistant Cast](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/cast/#home-assistant-cast) feature − you can finally say goodbye to Google Photos! 🎉

```yaml
- service: cast.show_lovelace_view
  data:
    entity_id: media_player.<your-chromecast-device>
    dashboard_path: lovelace
    view_path: photo-frame
```

Show memory card for the specific date on the dashboard:  

Add new template sensor:

```yaml
- sensor:
    - name: "Immich Memory Lane Details"
      unique_id: immich_memory_lane_details
      icon: mdi:image-text
      state: >
        {% set details = [ 
          [
            (state_attr('image.immich_memory_lane', 'media_exif') or {}).get('city'), 
            (state_attr('image.immich_memory_lane', 'media_exif') or {}).get('country')
          ] | select | join(', '), 
          as_datetime(state_attr('image.immich_memory_lane', 'media_localdatetime')).strftime('%d %B, %Y') 
          if as_datetime(state_attr('image.immich_memory_lane', 'media_localdatetime')) else '' 
        ] | select | join(' - ') %}
        {{ details if details else '' }}
```

And new card to dashboard:  
```yaml
type: picture-entity
entity: image.immich_memory_lane
show_state: false
show_name: false
camera_view: live
fit_mode: cover
grid_options:
  rows: 3
visibility:
  - condition: state
    state_not: unknown
  - condition: state
    state_not: unavailable
card_mod:
  style: |
    ha-card::after {
      content: "{{ states('sensor.immich_memory_lane_details') }}";
      display: {{ 'none' if states('sensor.immich_memory_lane_details') in ['', 'unknown', 'unavailable'] else 'block' }};
      position: absolute;
      bottom: 0px;
      left: 0;
      right: 0;
      color: white;
      text-align: center;      
      font-size: 15px;
      font-weight: bold;      
      text-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.9);      
      padding: 20px 0 5px 0;  /* top right bottom left */
      background: linear-gradient(
        to top,
        rgba(0,0,0,0.95) 0%,
        rgba(0,0,0,0.75) 40%,
        rgba(0,0,0,0.35) 70%,
        transparent 100%
      );
    }

```

## How does it work?

The integration can provide multiple `image` entities, which each correspond to an album. Each entity will switch to a new random image every 5 minutes.

These entities can be displayed using standard lovelace cards − for example, the `picture`, or `picture-entity` cards.

## Configuration

You can set up the Immich integration right from the web UI.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=immich)

You will need to enter your instance's URL and an API key. You can generate it from your Account Settings, on your Immich instance.

### Exposing other albums

By default, only the "Favorites" album is exposed as an entity.

You can expose more albums on the integration's options page.

> [!WARNING]  
> Exposing many albums might consume a lot of resources on your Home Assistant machine, and will also increase the number of calls to your Immich instance.
